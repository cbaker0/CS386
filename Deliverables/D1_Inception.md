D1 Inception

Group 06 – “Project Jacks”
Date and location: 
Group Members: Matthew Martinez, Ricardo Chairez, Carlea Baker, Alenn Wright

1. Introduction
	In today’s world we have access to advanced technology and lightning-quick internet. We felt as if the current JacksPlanner provided to us by NAU is not what it should be. We took it upon ourselves to create an improved, easier to use version. Project Jacks is an online planner that will help students plan their classes for upcoming semesters in a sleek and comprehensive fashion. We’re taking the grievances that students have with the current Jacks Planner and are fixing them up. Possible additions for the future include adding time sensitive class recommendations (making sure you have enough time to get to your classes) and professor “ratings”.
